 



sshhh

yesterday I did not speak at all

I drove on a road and no one 

heard I was breathing

did I breathe then?

or did the road swallow 

my breath?


shush now

do you always have to start?


I have learned to rip open the gap

make it wide until it generates

but after the gap follows the sentence

the attempt to create a whole

breath inwards

attempt to

speak



I had stopped, you know. silence

is protective. it is also deceitful.

I cannot shed skin

knows silence. my skin the gap. lick the

salt off. spit it out. I’ll be an ocean,

dull and dense I absorb.

I feel your silence now. everyone’s silence is different. 
have you noticed? for some a hammer smashed the 
noise. for others a knife slit open their mouth and it  
still stings. for others, again, silence hovered over  
them so long until it crushed their teeth. I want  
to know all silences. I believe that then 
nothing can happen to me.



























If I ever wanted to tell someone I liked them I'd say: I 
want to taste your silence. I want to lick it, caress it,
then put it inside me. feel its rhythm. smell it after 
it has mixed with my saliva. absorb its temperature 
when it erupts on my skin. but I don’t. remember 
I’m the ocean? salt is not a taste. it’s the 
burning that excites taste buds. it’s what 
sucks water out of skin. what stays after 
is silence. that’s what I’m after. 
shrimpled cucumber and
no words to mourn.



















yesterday someone had 
a finger inside me.
our lips were very close, 
normal procedure.
he exhaled, I inhaled.

he put another one in, 
and shortly I was dizzy
because I'd inhaled his absence.
his eyes were wide open, 
I caressed his cheek.


as we rode this rhythm, I felt, 
down in my groin  
that I could never 
penetrate his silence.

afterwards I was full and covered. 
that was due to biology.

the next morning I woke up 
feeling hollow. how

bridge a breath when
up against the most cunning
of all enemies: air
evades, suddenly swallows

the words escaping
outwards to
breathe into
one another other














what is a synonym for silence?

don’t

even dictionaries

only pretend they can

fill the absence













#


I was alone
washed up against coast
waves crashing into me from
behind coming to a stop
I coughed a letter, a grain, a
drop to streams
dreams as
I fell asleep tide in tide out
carried by water, lonely

mass
yet no plural
never ending
always raging
or in between storms
I forgot about my
arms and legs
I was expanding
 across and land

only a faint
memory
float until
finally I will birth
emptiness,
spat out into
the womb
of great
abandon


#

I was floating away
on this patch I’d called home only
sore, burns, scolded, so
up in the air I thought to find -
in fact, I was looking for a new slice of soil
not large, just wide enough to hold
the circumference of my body where
I could bloom, then rest in the sweet shade
for a bit, no skin shed, red peel

without end. at the end of the aisle
I glimpsed the sea
glisten in my eye
cold sparkle three
hours it had been and
already I was longing
enough already, I wanted
the initial the
primal touch:
feet arriving on soil
give me this relief,
I begged but
the steward came up straight away:
three more hours, hunny
we haven’t used up all the petrol yet
for now you’ll have to keep going
I bowed my head with resignation,
picked up the pen that had fallen to the floor


#

each side
above ribs
three slits
knife lowered
ink faded
I had blunted
who was I
if I didn’t
feel the cut or

pass it on?
red oval even
three hours on
I had removed
rhizomes had
covered clots with
palms peat-black
from digging impermeable
to all light lesion

sealed & flaming
underneath
I was falling
ground-bound
above only ice cream stands
with military jets dropping pink 
sprinkles from above
down; then wall of air compressed
against skin: pause before
speech, hover before

fall & whisper:
tip of tongue
before becoming
spit hit
cheek opposite I am
here / have spoken / have there a
trace smeared on saliva
sliding on skin & nothing
else to lick
















I have so little tools

I type faint

space

line break

and stroke
10 strokes just now

did you notice?

did you know

even space is a stroke

leave the gap and you’ll stop beating
swallowed into the inverted mass that

pretends it is none












what if silence is
not something
to investigate
what if silence
is all you know
what if you don’t
perceive it
because you were
never allowed
to know sound
















yesterday I ate a handful of salt flakes 

& they scraped my tongue

so sour, so crunchy

I spoke & all sounds sore

I wrote & all letters punctured

once there had been a match 

of letter to sound

now an alphabet was needed that 

I did not know

a friend had told me of this 

experience once, how her

tongue ran over sounds or spat them 

out when not needed:

the gap as one system leaped 

into the other.

I spat out the salt in hope of escape

but my tongue had deflated

I put a finger on its essence and started

rubbing off the coating

the falling flakes glistened and 

I was incapable.

I invited my friend over & we blew the

shavings into letters &

sang each other sounds

maybe reduction results in

the right kind of silence

she said &

I could not muster a response










there is this story of a child that did not speak, 
until it spoke, and then it couldn't stop speaking.
what is this then? someone is speaking, but 
who isn’t? who do we crush when we caress?













                                      




                                                        ¶

is this is how you multiply

tongues so the voice survives?

voice to wave, speech to paper, paper

to screen. tongue cut off. fast forward and

we resonate into oblivion. we never break

the cycle. just replicate what had

been built for us.






























in my bed there is a silhouette that I wrap my legs 
around when I cannot sleep. when I do that, usually 
the inverted sound has grated against my skin. my 
breath moves in the known rhythm but the cycles 
remain incomplete. I put a finger in my mouth 
but I know it’s mine. I slap my face and wonder 
if it is possible to share this space, endless & 
dull, if in this space you can spread silence 
with, then descend together. I wrap 
my arms around the silhouette and fall asleep.

silence is

                   violence
silence is

                   the absence of production


?
















who infiltrated silence:

those who don’t profit off of it
those who          profit off of it
those who profit off of it


?

pull / push
click / tap

shrieks at finger

tips /

floor cracked /
descent into

that which

numbs counters &
scrapes against scalp

sweet blasphemous silence
on this holy day

the sea, if you think about it, is equally silent as it is 
loud. watch the hot ball set on it and you’ll believe it 
can do no harm. golden, magenta, turquoise! a perfect 
evening love affair. but listen carefully and you will 
realise you have fallen for its loud lie. the sea 
carries whatever we throw on it, then swallows.
therefore its underneath rages. its silence offers 
possibility. I don’t mean this in a good way. 
be frightened of its endless expansion. 
the sea multiplies until we’ve forgotten
the hot sand kissing our feet,
extending into endless vertical 
abandon. some people know this
already but you were 
too busy drowning 
out the noise.














which collective would have continued
if I had continued to stop?
which flakes would have remained absent, 
flickering mid-air, if I had driven down
the road and evaded my breath?
embraced the page
blank /
inherited /
unshakeable /
                        ?














a beginning is the inception of an order

silence is its assertion

 
(build a structure by leaving space around it; 
silence is the air that allow it to breathe)




an end begins with the recognition of an order

silence is its collapse


(destroy a structure by expanding the silence around it; 
silence is the space that cuts off its air)












disrupt the noise
or suffocate its absence
;
sing me a song of
the fullness of quiet
;
scraping spacings shavings
escaping the urn, scattered over
;
wave swallowed before it
broke on the shore
;
still water kisses toes
touch, reach until halt
;
